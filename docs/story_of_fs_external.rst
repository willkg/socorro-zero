The story of the fs external
============================

The world was without local form and quiet. There was no memory and without
memory, there was no time.

The gods got bored and created a volume and the mists of time began to spin up.
In the mists, tiny bits of corporeal matter began to swirl and smash into one
another. Clumps of matter grew until ouf of the clumps there was object.

object was pretty boring all things considered, so the gods took object and
threw some configuration infrastructure on him and begat RequiredConfig.

RequiredConfig looked down and around and was confused. She looked at the gods
and they were confused, too. Then she created a Namespace and began to name all
the things.

RequiredConfig was happy, but alone. She also had difficulties remembering
things like where she put her coffee. It was for this reason that she begat
CrashStorageBase.

CrashStorageBase begat FSRadixTreeStorage who married and begat the twins
FSLegacyRadixTreeStorage and FSDatedRadixTreeStorage.

FSDatedRadixTreeStorage was the farer of the two and FSLegacyRadixTreeStorage
was jealous and hateful. The two fought often.

RequiredConfig and the gods took notice and forced them to mate hoping that the
joys and sorrows would settle out. This holy union begat
FSLegacyDatedRadixTreeStorage.

However, it was not a happy moment. No one liked FSLegacyDatedRadixTreeStorage
and he was never invited to parties because no one could remember his name. He
was sad. One night during a long night of drunkenness, the gods had pity on him.
FSTemporaryStorage was begatted.

FSTemporaryStorage had the gifts of his ancestors and used them to make the
world a better place. And it was good.
