My socorro-zero development environment plus notes.

This has the following:

1. some notes on socorro so I don't forget, including my primer
2. a script to pull down all the repositories making up Socorro
3. a bunch of my opinions codified in 21-carat GOLD

.. Warning::

   It's possible that this is wrong, obsolete, old, overbearing,
   over-engineered, under-thought, unofficial, and disasterous to your
   career.

Having said that, if it's helpful, let me know. If you have problems,
write up an issue.


Setup
=====

Run::

    make setup


Zero? What?
===========

This isn't a single Python package, but rather a development environment
with a set of configurations and opinions codified in it. The idea is
that you set it up and then you can do the work you need to do.

The idea is based on the ideas in this blog post:
